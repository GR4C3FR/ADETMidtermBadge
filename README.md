## ✅ Features Checklist

| Step | Requirement | Achieved in App |
|------|------------|----------------|
| Step 1 - Abstraction | Create an abstract class that all mini-tools follow with title, icon, and buildBody structure. | ✅ Achieved - All modules implement a shared structure ensuring consistent navigation and UI contract. |
| | Abstract getters: title, icon | ✅ Implemented in all modules. |
| | Abstract method: buildBody(context) | ✅ Each module provides its own UI through buildBody. |
| Step 2 - Inheritance | Create 3 concrete modules implementing the abstract class. | ✅ Achieved - BMI Checker, Expense Tracker, Grade Calculator extend the shared module. |
| | Each module must present a complete UI | ✅ Achieved - All modules display independent UI screens with proper input, buttons, and output. |
| Step 3 - Encapsulation | Private state management in each module. | ✅ Achieved - Each module uses private variables for inputs and results. |
| | Controlled updates via methods (compute/reset/add) | ✅ Achieved - Modules update state internally, results cannot be edited directly from outside. |
| Step 4 - Widget Literacy | Use minimum required widgets: Scaffold, AppBar, Text, Icon, Container/Card, TextField, Button, ListView, SnackBar/Dialog, Navigation. | ✅ Achieved - All modules include appropriate widgets across screens. |
| | Use Slider or Dropdown for configurable values | ✅ Achieved - Slider used for Tip%, and Dropdown is used on BMI Height Unit |
| Step 5 - Polymorphism | Use a polymorphic collection of modules to generate navigation items and display screens dynamically. | ✅ Achieved - All modules stored in a list and navigated via BottomNavigationBar. |
| Step 6 - Dynamic Invocation | Display module title, icon, and UI dynamically when switching tabs. | ✅ Achieved - Navigation correctly updates UI based on selected module. |
